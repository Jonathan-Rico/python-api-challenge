# python-api-challenge
In the WeatherPy.ipynb file, we create a script which uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from a list of cities. With this data, we generate a series of scatter plots which showcase the relationship between latitude and four weather variables. The script computes linear regression for each relationship separated by the northern and southern hemisphere, in which we can see the latitude has the most impact on a city's temperature, while for the other three variables (humidity, cloudiness and wind speed) latitude had minimal impact. The script also outputs the cities' information dataframe into a csv file, as well as creating png files for the scatter plots that showcase the relationship between latitude and the 4 weather variables.
In the VacationPy script, we use the dataframe created by the WeatherPy script and the googlemaps API and gmaps python library to create maps that display each city in the dataframe, showing each city's humidity intensity. In addition, we provide a set of parameters which we would consider our ideal weather conditions for a vacation to create a smaller dataframe. With this new dataframe we use the googlemaps API to find a hotel nearest to the locations in the smaller dataframe, and add the hotel's name to the new dataframe. With this new data we create a map that displays the hotels as red 'pins', which we can hover/click over to get additional information about the city in the map.
